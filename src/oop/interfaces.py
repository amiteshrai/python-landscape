    Python Interfaces Module
    ========================

    Interfaces play an important role in software engineering. As an application grows,
    updates and changes to the code base become more difficult to manage.

    More often than not, you wind up having classes that look very similar but are
    unrelated, which can lead to some confusion.

# An informal Python interface is a class that defines methods that can be overridden,
